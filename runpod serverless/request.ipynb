Then, while browsing through old books, my eyes might catch a flicker or a glint of something out of place—a uneven gap between two tomes or a barely noticeable crack. Intrigued, I’d get closer, maybe run my fingers along the shelf to see if there’s something sticking out or a surface that feels different from the others. If that doesn’t work, perhaps I’d try moving some books aside to inspect the wall behind them. If the door is hidden, it might not be immediately obvious, so patience and a careful eye would be key. Once found, I’d probably gasp in surprise, my mind racing with thoughts of ancient secrets and adventures waiting to be discovered."
