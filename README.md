# LLM Serving

This project is a collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring different ways to serve Large Language Models (LLMs). This is primarily focused on interactive storytelling and character-driven roleplay chatbots. The goal is to compare different frameworks and deployment methods to optimize response times, scalability, and efficiency while maintaining a high-quality user experience. 

### Contents  

- **Serving Methods:** 
  - Kobold AI   
  - vLLM  

- **Deployment Options:**  
  - Kaggle or Colab Notebook
  - RunPod Notebook
  - Converting to Docker containers for RunPod serverless deployment
  - Using pre-built docker images
 
### Key Considerations

**1. Deployment & Integration**
- **API Endpoints:** Should support RESTful or WebSocket APIs for real-time interactions.
- **Support for Fine-Tuned Models:** Allows deployment of models optimized for roleplay.  

**2. Model Serving Capabilities**
- **Efficient Inference:** Support for optimized LLM serving (e.g., vLLM, TensorRT, or DeepSpeed).
- **Batch Processing:** Combines multiple queries for faster execution.
- **GPU Acceleration:** Required for running large models efficiently.

**3. Performance & Scalability**
- **Low Latency:** Fast response times are crucial for a smooth chatbot experience.
- **Autoscaling:** The server should handle traffic spikes without downtime.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes requests efficiently to prevent overload.

**4. Cost Efficiency**
- **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing:** Avoid paying for unused resources.
- **Spot Instances (Cloud Providers):** Can reduce costs for non-critical workloads.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Use quantization and model optimizations to reduce compute requirements.

**5. Uptime & Reliability**
- **High Availability (HA):** Use redundant servers to prevent downtime.
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** Choose providers offering 99.9%+ uptime.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Real-time analytics to detect failures and optimize performance.

**5. Security & Compliance**  
- **Data Encryption:** Secure chat logs and user data.
